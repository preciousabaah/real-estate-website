      <p>Since the dawn of time, human beings have appreciated beauty and effectiveness.As a result,
        we’ve kept an upward trend of development in both art and technology.

        This same trend continues in the virtual world. When people find a beautiful website that caters
        to their specific needs, they keep returning to it. The real estate industryis no exception. With
        5.18 billion people already using the internet, it is nearly obligatory that all businesses, including
        real estate agencies, have their websites up and running.

        Since a person spends around 6 hours 40 minutes online each day, it is only sensible that a website with
        fantastic aesthetics and value delivery will be able to rake in and retain more customers.It’s of paramount
        importance that a real estate agent knows what components of their website make it stand out.</p>

          <img src="images/img7.jpg" alt="image" style="width:1250px; height: 400px;">
        </div>

        <p> Since having a website designed and developed can be a significantly daunting task, we have decided to
          present
          to you websites that are already successfully running. If you like any one (or more) of them, all you have to
          do
          is share the link with the web design company of your choice. If they are competent, building a website based
          on
          your choice samples (and providing custom features) from our site list would be no challenge for them.

          Thus, we have found out over 60 running websites. We have ranked them on the overall design, visual
          aesthetics,user
          interface, user experience, colour choice, and features provided.

          Our filtering process boiled our initial list to 16, which, according to us, are the best real estate website
          designs.

          Have a look and decide which ones are to your liking.</p>
